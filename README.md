BuzzFizz Class and Console Application

Running the ConsoleApp2.exe application will first output the BuzzFizz Solution using a static method in the BuzzFizz class with an upperbound of 100 passed into the method as a parameter of type int. It will then output the BuzzFizz Solution based on an object istance of the BuzzFizz class where the upperbound of 150 is passed into the constructor method and then the public non-static method is called.  Finally, if you decided to pass a valid integer argument to the ConsoleApp2.exe application, it will output the BuzzFizz Solution based on this upperbound value you have supplied.  The application will handle an invalid argument.
